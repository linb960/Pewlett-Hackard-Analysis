# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
 
## Overview of the Analysis
Pewlett Hackard, PH, would like to find out the job titles of retiring employees.  They also want to identify employess who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.  This will help them prepare for a "silver tsunami" as current employees reach retirement age.

## Setup for Analysis
PH has provided several Human Resource files in comma-separated values, CSV, format.  To provide the information PH wants about retirees PostgresSQL is used.  First, prior to creating a database from the files, and after viewing the raw files, an entity relationship diagram is created to map out the relationships between the files so that they can become tables within the database.  The ERD for this project looks like this:  <br>



## Results
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
